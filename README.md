#SOPBot

Simple discord bot made for fun. Will update Readme at a later date.

Currently bot can;

host Minecraft server for discord Users.
Note: You will need to port forward the network and provide IP to users who you want 
to connect. 

Handle images such as PNG, JPG, GIF, etc to be stored and added as "reactions" which 
will be displayed using the format ~<reaction_name>

Mini soundboard to add funny sound clips to be played by bot. Currently only 
Youtube links.


This is more of an exploration project were I would attempt to implement stuff on bot. This bot was also aimed to be
hosted on a Raspberry pi.
If you want to add some feature to this feel free to.
